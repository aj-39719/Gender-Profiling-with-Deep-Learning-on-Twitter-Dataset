# Gender-Profiling-with-Deep-Learning-on-Twitter-Dataset
This project was submitted as a part of my academic requirement towards my course in Deep Learning at LSE. The Data used in the project was generously provided by the organizers of PAN CLEF 2017. We apply 3 approaches to the project - 

1. Deep average Network
2. CNN with LSTM 
3. BiDirectional RNN with Attention mechanism

The data set can be requested on the following link - https://pan.webis.de/clef17/pan17-web/author-profiling.html#data
